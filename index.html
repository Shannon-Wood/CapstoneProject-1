      <h1>About Me</h1><br>
      <p>I have lived in four states: New Mexico<span class="italic"> (born & raised)</span>, Texas, Colorado and Wyoming.<br><br>
      I have been married for 21 years to my wife, Kimberly and I have two fabulous daughters: Gabrianna (16) and Genevieve (13).<br><br>
      My first experience with coding came when my parents bought my first computer when I was about 10 years old â€” a TRS-80 Color Computer from Radio Shack. I would read the manual for hours learning BASIC.<br><br>
      At the age of 14, my dad put me to work in his print shop, Pip Printing.  I worked there through high school and college. I then moved to Lubbock, TX and landed a job with Copy Craft Printers, Inc. I began working as a National Sales Representative, but moved to Pre-Press and Graphic Design when the department was started a little over a year later.<br><br>
      Some years later, after my wife and I had our second daughter, we thought it was time to start living our dream of being closer to the mountains, so we moved to Fort Collins, CO. While there, I worked at Color Pro Printing and the Poudre River Public Library.  Concurrently, my wife was commuting to Cheyenne to teach kindergarten at Afflerbach Elementary <span class="italic">(where she is still currently working).</span><br><br>
      We then moved to Cheyenne in 2013 when I received a job offer from Pioneer Printing to work in their Graphic Design & Pre-Press department. I worked for them until they closed their doors at the end of 2017.<br><br>
      At this point, I found a job working for the library in Cheyenne, but I knew something fantastic was right around the corner, and that's when I decided to join the 4th class at Array!
